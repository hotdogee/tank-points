TankPoints 2.0 - A benchmark for survivalbility gear.

** About TankPoints **

TankPoints was created to help compare different pieces of tanking gear, because it was difficult to decided at a glance like whether +12 defense is better then +1 dodge.

TankPoints can be seen as how much raw damage you can take before damage reduction, it considers your max health, armor, defense, dodge, parry, block, block value, resilience, crushing blow chance, miss, crit reduction, talants, buffs, stance/forms, and more.

Keep in mind though, that higher TankPoints does not make a better tank, it is only a benchmark for survivalbility gear but does not calculate threat.
It can not decide for you what you should wear for what boss, but it can provide you with a wealth of information what will hopfully be useful for choosing gear.


** About TankPoints 2.0 **

TankPoints 2.0 is a complete rewrite of my original TankPoints for WoW 2.0+ using the Ace2 framework.

It has a much improved TankPoints algorithm, intergrates nicely into the character stats dropdown menu, and shows a lot more information then the original TankPoints.

2.0 introduced a new combat ratings system which made it even harder to compare gear, in order to code combat rating support for TankPoints, the exact rating to percentage formula is required which Blizzard didn't give us.
Luckly, I have suceessfully reverse engineered the rating formula for all levels and coded an addon called "Rating Buster" that converts ratings on item tooltips into percentages, you can try it out here.

** The value of Block **

The value is Shield Block Value and Block Rating is highly dependent on what you are tanking.
Its very good for mobs that don't hit very hard like in heroics, but is worth much less on hard hitting bosses in 25 man raids.
At level 80, TankPoints' default mob damage is tuned to 25 man raids, with a value of 24365 damage before mitigation.
You can change this value to match what you plan on tanking by using the "/tp mob damage" command in game.
A mob damage of 10505 for example is a good value for level 80 heroics.

TankPoints also calculates the value of Shield Block for Warriors, and Holy Shield for Paladins.
You can use the "/tp player sbfreq" command to set a shield block frequency that matches your rotation (in how many seconds AFTER cooldown finishes).
For most tankadins rotations, you will have a 100% Holy Shield uptime, using "/tp player sbfreq 1" will tell TankPoints that you will use Holy Shield 1 second after cooldown finishes (every 9 secs).



** TankPoints 2.0 Features **

In addition to the original formula, the Imporved TankPoints 2.0 formula now has:
- support for all combat ratings including the new resilience stat
- support for block% and block value
- support for various class specific talants and buffs
- support for crushing blows
- support for combat table and correctly caps off at a total of 100%
  using Hit < Crushing < Crit < Block < Parry < Dodge < Miss
- support for mob stats:
  - mob level - defaults player level +3
  - mob damage
  - mob melee crit chance
  - mob melee crit bonus
  - mob melee miss chance
  - mob spell crit chance
  - mob spell crit bonus
  - mob spell miss chance

Improved TankPoints Calculator

TankPoints User Interface(See Screeshots):
- Intergrated in to the Character stats dropdown menu
- When TankPoints is selected it displays:
  - TankPoints
  - Melee Damage Reduction
  - Block Value
  - Spell TankPoints
  - Spell Damage Reduction
- TankPoints tooltip:
  - Your stance
  - Mob Stats
    - Mob Level
    - Mob Damage (after damage reduction)
    - Mob Crit Chance
    - Mob Miss Chance
  - TankPoints per StatValue - Shows how much TankPoints you gain for each stats with equal item values, because the values below are equal in the item value formula, you can use this data to see what gives the most bang for the buck in terms of item budgets.
    - 1 Agility = 
    - 1.5 Stamina = 
    - 10 Armor = 
    - 1 Resilience = 
    - 1 Defense Rating = 
    - 1 Dodge Rating = 
    - 1 Parry Rating = 
    - 1 Block Rating = 
    - 1.54 Block Value
  - Option to hold down ALT key will show how much TankPoints you gain for each stat point
    - 1 Agility
    - 1 Stamina
    - 1 Armor
    - 1 Resilience
    - 1% Defense
    - 1% Dodge
    - 1% Parry
    - 1% Block
    - 1 Block Value
- Melee Damage Reduction tooltip:
  - Armor Damage Reduction against mob level - Useful because the default armor tooltip only shows the reduction for the same level
  - Mob Level, Player Level
  - Combat Table - Hit < Crushing < Crit < Block < Parry < Dodge < Miss
    The total of these chances must be capped at 100%, if you exceed 100% then lower priority values will be pushed off the table. 
    For example, when you press shield block (+75% block chance), hit, crush and crit will all be pushed off and will be 0, your real block chance will also be capped at (100% - Parry% - Dodge% - Miss%)
- Block Value tooltip - Block Value should have been included in the default UI, but they didn't so I coded my own function that does it, strength, items, talents(warrior, paladin, shaman) are all considered in the algorithm.
  - Mob Damage before Damage Reduction (armor and stance effects)
  - Mob Damage after Damage Reduction
  - Blocked percentage = Block Value / Mob Damage after DR
  - Block Chance
  - Equivalent Block Mitigation = Block Chance * Blocked percentage
    This can be seen equal with the same amount of dodge or parry.
- Spell TankPoints Tooltip - Shows your strongest school by default
  - Your stance
  - TankPoints at the following Melee/Spell Damage Ratio
    - 25% Melee Damage + 75% <school> damage
    - 50% Melee Damage + 50% <school> damage
    - 75% Melee Damage + 25% <school> damage
  - Can manually cycle through all schools by left clicking the stat
  - Reset back to showing the strongest school by right click the stat
- Spell Damage Reduction - Shows your strongest school by default
  - Shows damage reductions for all schools
  - Same click functions as the Spell TankPoints Tooltip

** TankPoints Formulas **

=== Armor Reduction ===
levelModifier = attackerLevel
if ( levelModifier > 59 ) then
  levelModifier = levelModifier + (4.5 * (levelModifier - 59))
end
armorReductionTemp = armor / ((85 * levelModifier) + 400)
armorReduction = armorReductionTemp / (armorReductionTemp + 1)
if armorReduction > 0.75 then
  armorReduction = 0.75
end
if armorReduction < 0 then
  armorReduction = 0
end

=== Defense Effect ===
- defenseEffect = (defense - attackerLevel * 5) * 0.04 * 0.01

=== Block Value From Strength ===
- blockValueFromStrength = floor(totalStr * 0.5 - 10)

=== Block Value ===
- blockValue = floor((floor(totalStr * 0.5 - 10) + blockValueFromItems + blockValueFromShield) * blockValueMod)

=== Mob Damage (default formula) ===
- mobDamage = (levelModifier * 55) * meleeTakenMod * (1 - armorReduction)

=== Resilience Effect ===
- resilienceEffect = ReverseRating(resilience, playerLevel) * 0.01

=== Mob Crit Chance ===
- mobCritChance = max(0, 0.05 - defenseEffect - resilienceEffect)

=== Mob Crit Bonus ===
- mobCritBonus = 1

=== Mob Miss Chance ===
- mobMissChance = max(0, 0.05 + defenseEffect)

=== Mob Crush Chance (if mobLevel is +4 or more) ===
- mobCrushChance = (mobLevel - playerLevel) * 0.1 - 0.15

=== Mob Crit Damage Mod ===
- mobCritDamageMod = max(0, 1 - resilienceEffect * 2)

=== Blocked Mod ===
- blockedMod = min(1, blockValue / mobDamage)

=== Mob Spell Crit Chance ===
- mobSpellCritChance = max(0, 0 - resilienceEffect)

=== Mob Spell Crit Bonus ===
- mobSpellCritBonus = 0.5

=== Mob Spell Miss Chance ===
- mobSpellMissChance = 0

=== Mob Spell Crit Damage Mod ===
- mobSpellCritDamageMod = max(0, 1 - resilienceEffect * 2)

=== Resistance Reduction ===
- schoolReduction[SCHOOL] = 0.75 * (resistance[SCHOOL] / (mobLevel * 5))

=== Melee Total Reduction ===
- totalReduction[MELEE]
 = 1 - (1 - Avoidance) * (1 - Mitigation) * DamageTakenMod
 = 1 - (1 - blockChance * blockedMod - parryChance - dodgeChance - mobMissChance + (mobCritChance * mobCritBonus * mobCritDamageMod) + (mobCrushChance * 0.5)) * (1 - armorReduction) * meleeTakenMod

=== Spell Total Reduction ===
- totalReduction[SCHOOL] = 1 - ((mobSpellCritChance * (1 + mobSpellCritBonus) * mobSpellCritDamageMod) + (1 - mobSpellCritChance - mobSpellMissChance)) * (1 - schoolReduction[SCHOOL]) * spellTakenMod

=== TankPoints ===
- tankPoints = playerHealth / (1 - totalReduction)

=== EffectiveHealth (EH) ===
- effectiveHealth[MELEE] = playerHealth * 1 / (1 - (1 - armorReduction) * damageTakenMod)
- effectiveHealth[SCHOOL] = playerHealth * 1 / (1 - damageTakenMod)
In other words: how much health you have times how much that health translates into raw damage when you're hit

=== EffectiveHealthWithBlock (EHB) ===
For every swing of the mob (see mobAtkSpeed) until you are out of health
    if time to press the shield block button given timeBetweenPresses
       refresh charges on shield block
    if mobHitChance + mobCrushChance + mobCritChance == 0 or
      (charges left and mobHitChance + mobCrushChance + mobCritChance <= 75%)
       use a charge on shield block
       min(healthLeft, take raw damage from the monster per mobDamage - blockValue)
    else
       min(healthLeft, take raw damage from the monster per mobDamage)
    end
end

EHB is the sum of the raw damage before death.

The algorithm does not take chance into account - just the variables
you feed it in terms of the mobDamage, mobAtkSpeed, and
timeBetweenPresses.

Paladins are not calculated yet.
